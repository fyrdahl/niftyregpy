NiftyRegPy is an independently developed wrapper for NiftyReg. NiftyReg is a package for efficient medical image registration which contains tools for rigid, affine and non-linear registration. It is currently developed at the `School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences (KCL-BMEIS) <https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis>`_ at `King's College London <https://www.kcl.ac.uk/>`_. Earlier development were supported by the `Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cmic>`_ in the `Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medphys>`_ at `University College London <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/>`_.

This package is not affiliated with the authors of NiftyReg, KCL-BMEIS, CMIC, King's College London or University College London.
If you're using NiftyReg in your research, please cite the appropriate publications:

The rigid and affine registration are performed using an algorithm initially presented by :footcite:t:`2001:Ourselin`. The symmetric versions of the rigid and affine registration have been presented in :footcite:t:`2014:Modat`.
The non-linear registration is based on the work initially presented by :footcite:t:`1999:Rueckert`. The current implementation has been presented in :footcite:t:`2010:Modat`.
