Niftyregpy is designed to be a pythonic wrapper to the NiftyReg image registration package, developed at School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London (KCL-BMEIS) and the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London.

This package is in no way affiliated with the authors of NiftyReg, KCL-BMEIS, CMIC, King's College London or University College London.
If you're using NiftyReg in your research, please cite the appropritate publications:

The rigid and affine registration are performed using an algorithm initially presented by Ourselin et al.[1]. The symmetric versions of the rigid and affine registration have been presented in Modat et al.[2].
The non-linear registration is based on the work is based on the work initially presented by Rueckert et al.[3]. The current implementation has been presented in Modat et al.[4].

For more information about the NiftyReg package, please refer to `the official GitHub repo <https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg>`_, or `the NiftyReg website <http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg>`_.
